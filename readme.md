# YDNAB (You Do need a budget)

Stealing name from ynab because I couldn't think of a better one. This app will help keep track of budgeting and other random things. 

Goal to build api in php (laravel5), frontend using Angular 2 (TS). How far will this come who knows? 

Database will use mysql for the time being.
